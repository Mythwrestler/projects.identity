# Identity Service

***DO NOT USE THIS AS DESIGNED WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING WHAT THIS IS DOING AND WHAT YOU WANT IT TO DO***

I'm building this identity service using openid connect and with the intention that it plugs into postgres.

The service will be compiled into a docker container and deployed into a k8s cluster.

Based on the excellent [walk through by Robin van der Knaap](https://dev.to/robinvanderknaap/setting-up-an-authorization-server-with-openiddict-part-i-introduction-4jid)
